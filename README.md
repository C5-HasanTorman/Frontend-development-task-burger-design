## Responsive Burger CSS Techniques

In this project, I have implemented several CSS techniques to ensure that the burger menu is fully responsive and adapts well to different screen sizes. The following techniques were utilized:

1. Viewport Units

I leveraged viewport units to create a responsive design that adapts to the user's viewport size. Viewport units, such as vw and vh , allow us to specify sizes and dimensions relative to the user's screen.


2. Media Queries

I employed media queries to apply specific CSS rules based on different screen widths. By defining breakpoints, I was able to target specific screen sizes and modify the burger Layers appearance and behavior accordingly. For example, I adjusted the container size to ensure optimal usability on both desktop and mobile devices.
